Worry???
=====

## Have you ever wondered what your child's height will be?  

## Is he/she going to be ....

- **Taller ?**
- *Shorter ??*
- Or the same height as you ???

Well, Galton has some data
======

Galton collected 928 observations of parents' and children's height. 

A sampling is shown below:


```
  parent child
1   70.5  61.7
2   68.5  61.7
3   65.5  61.7
4   64.5  61.7
5   64.0  61.7
6   67.5  62.2
```

**How do we use this to predict a child's height based on the parent's height?**


Let's take a closer look
=======

The data points seems to be clustered around a liner relationship.  
Let's fit a linear model (blue line) to it.
We can now use the linear model to __predict__ children's height!
